Fourth Call for ParticipationEUROLAN-2017 – Summer School on Biomedical Text Processing10 – 17 September 2017, Constan?a, Romaniahttp://eurolan.info.uaic.ro/2017/The 13th in the series of EUROLAN SchoolsBiomedical Text Mining (BioNLP) applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract information from scientific publications in biology, medicine, and chemistry, in order to discover novel knowledge that can contribute to biomedical research. The large size of the biomedical literature and its rapid growth in recent years make literature search and information access a demanding task. Health-care professionals in the clinical domain face a similar problem of information explosion when dealing with the ever-increasing body of available medical/health records in electronic form. Overall, the application of automatic NLP techniques to unstructured text in scientific literature and medical records enables life scientists to find and exploit this data.EUROLAN-2017 has engaged several well-known researchers in the fields of BioNLP and NLP to provide a comprehensive overview of language processing models and techniques applicable to the biomedical domain, ranging from an introduction to fundamental NLP technologies to the study of use cases and exploitation of available tools and frameworks that support BioNLP. Tutorial are accompanied by hands-on sessions.   Invited Lecturers and Topics (T=tutorial; H = Hands-on session)   * Mihaela Breab?n – “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Ia?i (Romania)T: Open-Source Frameworks for Big Data ProcessingH: Textual data processing on Hadoop* Kevin Cohen – University of Colorado School of Medicine (USA) and LIMSI, CNRS, Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay (France)T: Language and linguistics in NLP/NLP for biomedical languageH: Empirical investigations of the implications of the nature of biomedical language for the design of experiments in natural language processing   * Noa Patricia Cruz Diaz – Virgen del Rocio University Hospital (Spain)T: Negation and Speculation Detection in Biomedical TextsH: Rule-based versus machine-learning tools for automatic identification of negation   * Eric Gaussier – University Grenoble Alps (France)T: Information extraction.
